# RNWhatsAppStickers
## Getting started



`$ npm install react-native-wa-stickers-animated`

or

`$ yarn add react-native-wa-stickers-animated`

This package is modified version of react-native-whatsapp-sticker-dyanamic.

- I have added animated sticker support (see whatsapp requirement)
- You can pick images from your storage at runtime.
- To Update the sticker pack with new images simply change increase the version number of sticker pack
- You can't mix static and animated in same sticker pack. there is boolean flag to tell whatsapp if the pack is animated or static

I can't write the whole instruction due to schedule but I will update this Readme and clean the code asap
Also I am trying to add convertion methods so that user can pic any common file format and this module will fix the size acccording to whastapp requirement. Users have Gif or animated files and decoding frames of these formats is not easy like static files so it taking time as I am not noob in java but still trying hard to implement must have function. There is no other RN modules right now which supports animated dyanamic and resizing all in one. 

Feel free to discuss with me Twitter - @heyKSR

Read the instruction below and you have to add these new properties to the old config
``` js
  {
       image_data_version : // To update existing pack increase the version
        avoid_cache : bool 
        animated_sticker_pack : bool // true for animated false for static
  },
````
Documentation here does not match with the module. I did not update the readme file.
Below is instruction by react-native-whatsapp-sticker-dyanamic.

## Integration

For React Native versions < 0.60 use version 1.+ of this library and checkout the corresponding README file.

Please make sure you follow the requirements for sticker packs from WhatsApp. You can find them [here for iOS](https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers/tree/master/iOS#sticker-art-and-app-requirements) and [here for Android](https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers/tree/master/Android#sticker-art-and-app-requirements).

### iOS

#### Swift

1. Under `Build Settings` section `Build Options` set `Always Embed Swift Started Libraries` to `true`
2. Make sure you have the following under `library search paths`

```
$(inherited)
$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift/$(PLATFORM_NAME)
```

#### Info.plist
- Add the following to your `Info.plist`
```
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
  <array>
  <string>whatsapp</string>
</array>
```

#### Your Sticker Images
1. make sure they follow the guidelines from WhatsApp
2. Put the images somewhere in your project directory
3. drag and drop them into your XCode Project (recommended to a new folder)
4. check `Copy Items If Needed` in the dialogue that pops up and click `Finish`

**Done üéâ**

### Android

1. Create a `contents.json` file in `yourproject -> android -> app -> src -> main -> assets` following the following scheme.
**Improtant! Including dots in the identifier is causing troubles.**
```json
{
  "android_play_store_link": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myapp",
  "ios_app_store_link": "https://itunes.apple.com/app/myapp/id123456",
  "sticker_packs": [
    {
      "identifier": "myprojectstickers",
      "name": "MyProject Stickers",
      "publisher": "John Doe",
      "tray_image_file": "tray_icon.png",
      "publisher_email": "contact@myproject.com",
      "publisher_website": "https://myproject.com",
      "privacy_policy_website": "https://myproject.com/legal",
      "license_agreement_website": "https://myproject.com/license",
      "stickers": [
        {
          "image_file": "01_sticker.webp",
          "emojis": ["‚úåÔ∏è"]
        },
        {
          "image_file": "02_sticker.webp",
          "emojis": ["üòç","üòª"]
        },
        {
          "image_file": "03_sticker.webp",
          "emojis": ["üòé"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Place the WebP images in a folder with **with the same name** that you defined as `identifier` in the object above under the same directory. So your `assets` folder has the following structure:

```
assets
+-- contents.json
+-- identifier
|   +-- 01_sticker.webp
|   +-- 02_sticker.webp
|   +-- 03_sticker.webp
```

3. Add `noCompress` to your app `build.gradle` in `yourproject -> android -> app`
```gradle
android {
    ...
    aaptOptions {
        noCompress "webp"
    }
    ...
```

**Done üéâ**

## Usage

### Methods

Check if WhatsApp is available
```javascript
RNWhatsAppStickers.isWhatsAppAvailable()
  .then(isWhatsAppAvailable => console.log('available:', isWhatsAppAvailable))
  .catch(e => console.log(e))
```

#### iOS

1. Create a sticker pack
```javascript
import RNWhatsAppStickers from "react-native-whatsapp-stickers"

const config = {
  identifier: '',
  name: '',
  publisher: '',
  trayImageFileName: '',
  publisherEmail: '',
  publisherWebsite: '',
  privacyPolicyWebsite: '',
  licenseAgreementWebsite: '',
}

RNWhatsAppStickers.createStickerPack(config)
  .then(() => console.log('success'))
  .catch(e => console.log(e))
```

2. Add sticker
```javascript
RNWhatsAppStickers.addSticker('stickername.png', ['üòé'])
  .then(() => console.log('success'))
  .catch(e => console.log(e))
```

3. Send to WhatsApp
```javascript
RNWhatsAppStickers.send()
  .then(() => console.log('success'))
  .catch(e => console.log(e))
```

#### Android
You are already good to go with the sticker pack creation if you followed the `Integration` part.

1. Send to WhatsApp where `name` and `identifier` represent the values you defined in `contents.json`
```javascript
RNWhatsAppStickers.send('identifier', 'name')
  .then(() => console.log('success'))
  .catch(e => console.log(e))
```

### Example

#### App.js
```javascript
import { Platform } from "react-native";
import RNWhatsAppStickers from "react-native-whatsapp-stickers"
import { stickerConfig } from "./stickerConfig"

const { stickers, ...packConfig } = stickerConfig

RNWhatsAppStickers.isWhatsAppAvailable()
  .then(isWhatsAppAvailable => {
    if (isWhatsAppAvailable) {
      if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
        return RNWhatsAppStickers.createStickerPack(packConfig)
          .then(() => {
            const promises = stickers.map(item =>
              RNWhatsAppStickers.addSticker(item.fileName, item.emojis)
            )
            Promise.all(promises).then(() => RNWhatsAppStickers.send())
          })
          .catch(e => console.log(e))
      }

      return RNWhatsAppStickers.send('myprojectstickers', 'MyProject Stickers')
    }

    return undefined
  })
  .catch(e => console.log(e))
```

#### stickerConfig.js
```javascript
export const stickerConfig = {
  identifier: 'myprojectstickers',
  name: 'MyProject Stickers',
  publisher: 'John Doe',
  trayImageFileName: 'tray_icon.png',
  publisherEmail: 'contact@myproject.com',
  publisherWebsite: 'https://myproject.com',
  privacyPolicyWebsite: 'https://myproject.com/legal',
  licenseAgreementWebsite: 'https://myproject.com/license',
  stickers: [
    {
      fileName: '01_sticker.png',
      emojis: ['‚úåÔ∏è'],
    },
    {
      fileName: '02_sticker.png',
      emojis: ['üòç', 'üòª'],
    },
    {
      fileName: '03_sticker.png',
      emojis: ['üòé']
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting
<details>
  <summary>ld: warning: Could not find auto-linked library 'swiftFoundation'</summary>
  
  - Create an empty swift file in your project

  `xCode -> Click File -> new File -> empty.swift`

  **Important** Click yes when it asks for creating bridge-headers
</details>

## Roadmap
- Native implementation of method to check if WhatsApp is installed
- Consistend react-native api
